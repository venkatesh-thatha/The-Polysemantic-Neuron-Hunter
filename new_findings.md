Layer 0 (Neuron 1846):

Visual: Flat line, one distinct spike.

Role: "The Letter Reader." It sees one specific token ("by"). It is crisp and monosemantic.

Layer 3 (Neuron 1395):

Visual: A few spikes on logical markers ("The", ".", "but").

Role: "The Sentence Diagrammer." It tracks flow and pauses.

Layer 8 (Neuron 1253):

Visual: A jagged mountain range. It is active almost everywhere.

Role: "The Philosopher."

Why is it messy? By Layer 8, the model isn't looking at words anymore. It is looking at Meaning.

Notice what it is firing for: "gradient", "descent", "algorithm", "right", "action", "fruits".

It is firing for Substantive Concepts (important nouns/verbs). It ignores the filler words ("to", "a", "of").
